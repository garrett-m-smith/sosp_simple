# Self-organized sentence processing (SOSP): Simple, one-word parsing models

This is Python package for running self-organized sentence processing (SOSP; Smith, Franck, & Tabor, 2018, Cog. Sci.; Smith & Tabor, 2018, Proceedings of ICCM) simulations for human sentence processing.

This package is for running models of sentence processing at single words where the parameters are set manually. I plan to expand the documentation.
